Tube by Region
==============

**Tube by Region** is a hand-edited list of *good* YouTube channels. I want to make this because I find many good channels are not getting enough attention, and I welcome people around the world to add more channels, but I have some restrictions.

Someday, I hope this project will grow into something that would help people to discover really good quality channels and those channels can have audiences who appreciate them. Before that day, this will be a small list of channels I happen to come across by accidents mostly.
